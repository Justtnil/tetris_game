# üëæ Pixel Tetris - A Jetpack Compose Classic

A fully-featured, classic block-stacking game built from the ground up using 100% Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. This project is a modern take on a nostalgic favorite, designed to demonstrate the power and simplicity of declarative UI in Android development.

## üåü About The Project

This isn't just another Tetris clone. It's a complete mobile game project that has evolved with features requested by the user, showcasing an iterative development process. The focus was on clean state management, responsive layouts, and creating a fun, playable experience. The entire game logic and UI are contained within a single activity, leveraging the power of composable functions and coroutines.
